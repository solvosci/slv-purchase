By default, Order Date is hidden depending on the view/and or purchase order
state, because Confirmation Date is more relevant.
This addon makes Order Date, in that cases, always visible, this is achieved
showing an instrumental field linked to Order Date in the same cases that
Confirmation Date is shown.
